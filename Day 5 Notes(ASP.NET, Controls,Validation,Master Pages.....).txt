ASP.NET -> Active Server pages .net
Designing web pages on Client Side
HTML, Javascript/Jquery

Server -> Web Application -> DB-> server side pages
ASP.NET, JSP, Servlets, PHP

ASP.NET is used for developing web application using C# or VB.NET Languages
asp.net web pages can be designed using 
1. HTML
2. Asp.net Server side controls 
they are represented in tag format. They start with asp:
2 properties are very important for the server side controls
id = identify the control
runat=server

<asp:Label id="Label1" runat="server"/>
<asp:TextBox id="Label1" runat="server"/>
<asp:DropDownList id="Label1" runat="server"/>
<asp:RadioButton>
<asp:CheckBox>
<asp:ListBox/>
<asp:Button/>


asp.net creates 2 files for every web page we create
1. .aspx -> design 
2. .aspx.cs -> this is used for code behind file where we write code in C# which will validation, interact with DB, Trigger Events

ASP.NET 
IIS -internet information server is the web server for asp.net
IIS has a web server engine
It will take the request from the browser, it process the web page requested, It can connect to DB also
and it will send the response page as HTML o/p to the browser

when we are designing the web page in ASP.NET, IT is all drag and drop control

.aspx page -> 2 tabs below
Design Tab -> We can design the web page
Source Tab->HTML Code gets generated

Every Web Form control is defined in the namespace System.Web.UI.WebContols
All controls like TextBox, DropDownList, ListBox -> all these are inbuilt classes
naming conventions
txtName
txtAddress
txtDOB
ddlNationality
rbMale
rbFemale -> rb(radio Button)
to change the name of the control, we have to change its ID Property
Text-property is used to give caption to the control

groupname property of radio button selects only one among them


Web Form class inherit from System.Web.UI.Page
asp.net -> event driven architecture


validations can be done in asp.net using validation controls
Automatically the validation controls convert the code into javascript and we need not write a single line of javascript code
Javascript means validation happens on the browser side

requiredfieldvalidator -> check for blank values
rangevalidator-> this will check if data entered is in a particular range or not
regularExpressionvalidator -> this will check for formats like email, url, mobno
comparevalidator-> compare between 2 different values
customvalidator -> creating user specific validation
ValidationSummary -> It will display all the validations as list of summary on the web page

for all validators 2 properties are mandatory to give
ErrorMessage -> what is the error message to display
ControlToValidate -> on which control the validation should be performedl0
1 control can have multiple validators
1 validator can validate 1 control only

Custom Validator will execute on server side.
We have to execute a CS Code which will execute at the server side


master pages
common contents like logo , name of the company , set of common menus are defined in master pages
This master page will be referred inside other .aspx pages
 Donot design anything inside content place holder
as Name suggest, ContentPlaceHolder means it is the place where the contents of other aspx pages is displayed

We cannot execute a .master file directly
It has to be referred inside .aspx pages

Monday content

DataBinding -> ASP.NET -> interact with DB -> ADO.NET
