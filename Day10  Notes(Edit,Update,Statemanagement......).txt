Statemanagement is done in ASP.NET MVC

Alternate to Master pages in MVC

 When we are passing email as a data in URL it contains 2 special characters
@
.
Email+"/" is required when we r passing emailid in url

pizzaid -> do u require a "/" in this when it is passed as query string.
Ans: No , it does not contain any special character . Not required

Statemanagement in MVC
ViewBag   
its value becomes null when redirection occurs
It can hold the values for one request
get -> if we are retreiving the values in get
Post-> value will become null, rebind the value again
type conversion is not required as it stores data as dynamic datatype
It will determine the datatype of the value we have assigned at runtime
it is slower compared to view data
They are used to pass data from controller to view


ViewData
key- Value pair
ViewData["Key"]=value;
ViewData is faster than ViewBag
Type conversion is required when we are retreiving the value from it
its value becomes null when redirection occurs
It can hold the values for one request
get -> if we are retreiving the values in get
Post-> value will become null, rebind the value again
They are used to pass data from controller to view

TempData
will pass data between controllers. 
If we want to pass data between 2 consecutive request
TempData requires typecasting
Retain the Value stored in tempdata against consecutive request ,
TempData.Keep()

1. find if a PK value exist or not
2. Statemanagement
3. How to handle multiple submit button

Data is transferred from Controller to View
1. ModelBinding -> return View(var);
View ->@model PersonInfo
*note -> one view can refer one model class

2. ViewBag

3. ViewData

4. TempData


to handle multiple submit button group all the button by giving the same value in name attribute(property)
Master pages in MVC ->_Layout.cshtml
Every view we create will refer _ViewStart.cshtml
and in _ViewStart.cshtml we refer _Layout.cshtml which is under Views->Shared Folder

ContentPlaceHolder in MasterPages - what is it in MVC Pages ->@RenderBody
