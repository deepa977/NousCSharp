Assignment 1

Given an integer basic and a character grade which denotes the basic salary and grade of a person respectively, the task is to find the gross salary of the person.

Gross Salary: The final salary computed after the additions of DA, HRA and other allowances. The formula for Gross Salary is defined as below:

Gross Salary = Basic + HRA + DA + Allow – PF
Here, HRA = 20% of Basic 
DA = 50% of basic 
Allow = 1700 if grade = ‘A’ 
Allow = 1500 if grade = ‘B’ 
Allow = 1300 if grade = ‘C’ 
PF = 11% of basic

Examples:

Input: basic = 10000, grade = ‘A’
Output: 17600



 
2.Write a program to do the following:
Accept the item code, description, qty and price of an item. Compute the total for the item.
	
Accept the user’s choice. If the choice is ‘y’ then accept the next set of inputs for a new item and compute the total. In this manner, compute the grand total for all the items purchased by the customer.
	
If the grand total is more than Rs. 10,000/- then, the customer is allowed a discount of 10%.
	
If the grand total is less than Rs. 1,000/- and the customer chooses to pay by card, then a surcharge of 2.5% is levied on the grand total. 

Display the grand total for the customer.
