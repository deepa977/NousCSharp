Disconnected Architecture


Coding
Steps in Disconnected Architecture
1. Connect to Db with all Database Parameters
SqlConnection
2.select query 
SqlDataAdapter ->3 functions (open(), execute the select query, close())
No need to explicitly open and close the connection
3.Create a Dataset
4. Fill()-> fill the data of the select query to Dataset
5.Dataset changes is updated to DB by calling the Update()

Databinding Controls
These controls can show us what type of data is stored in the Dataset
DropDownList
GridView
FormView 
ResultView
ListBox

DataSet will hold the data in XML Format

When to use Connected Architecture

Your application is doing Insert, Update and delete queries which has to execute immediately in the Database , then go for connected architecture


When to use Disconnected architecture

If your application is a report generation application
which means we need a lot of select queries , then use disconnected architecture

Wizard

Post Back -> What ever data we have selected in the browser we are posting it back to the server
Becoz the data is sent to DB for processing 

Sending the data from client to server is called postback

autopostback ->post back should be done automatically

State management

we were transferring data from one project to another project
UI to DAL->EntityLayer (properties )

How to transfer data from one web page to another web page
is done the the help of Statemanagement

Client Side 
happens at browser level

Query String -> transfer data along with the URL on the address bar of the browser
Drawback ->
data can be easily manipulated in the URL as data is visible and not secured

Cookies->are used to store client data on the client machine but it uses server side code called cookies
if we clear history in the browser, cookies data is also cleared


viewState- is used to store data across page postback

Form - store data from html <form>

HiddenField- is a invisible control(o/p of this control will not be seen on the browser). It can store some calculated values

Server Side 
Session
session - time between login and logout is called as a session
Every browser instance connecting to the web server is identified by a unique ID called Session  ID
Session is used to transfer data between web pages
Sessions are used to transfer data from one web page to another and it is better compared to Query String
